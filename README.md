# My Machine learning projects
## Description : 
- **Bayesian reinforcement learning**(BayesianRL) : State of art of reinforcement learning techniques
and investigate the utility of modelling incertitude with probability in RL problems

- **Compressed sensing with generative model** (CSGM) : A refresh of compressed sensing
techniques with generative models: Replace the sparsity assumption with structure from generative mode

- **Topological consistency via kernel estimation** (TopCE) : Review of a consistent estimator
for the homology of level sets of both density and regression functions

- **Thompsom sampling** (TS): Review of Thompson sampling and its applications

- **Consistency of Bagging** (Bagging): Mathematics review of bagging
